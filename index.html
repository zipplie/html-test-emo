            <span>Oh, hi! You went to my site! I think I should tell you a little about myself. My name is Danil and I am from Russia. This site is my first serious project.
              I started programming relatively recently. My first programming language was Python, but I didn't really like it and <a href="https://github.com/zarkone">@zarkone</a>suggested that I try HTML.
              This is how I wrote this site. And you can read more about the site in the next part of the text, which is below.</span>

      <div id="aboutthesite">
        <h2>zipplie@site:~$</h2>
          <p>A little about the site: at the beginning it had a completely different design, but then I got the idea to do something on the console theme and I started to create.
                The result is what you can observe now. Evaluate whether it was good or bad to evaluate only you.
              In the second tab of the site, which is called<a href="sections/myprojects/myprojects.html">My Projects</a>, I will post a short description and links to the repositories of<a href="https://github.com/zipplie">my GitHub</a>projects.</p>
